<h1>Who We Are</h1>
<br />
<p>Friends of SMART Recovery is a community of people who have all chosen to use the evidence and science-based approach, SMART Recovery, in their individual journeys towards overcoming addictions and other maladaptive behaviors, and maintain sustainable sobriety while living a fulfilling and balanced life.</p>
<br />
<p>We connect with each other through a private Discord server in which we provide support for our peers in-between official SMART Meetings.</p>
<br />
<p>The Friends of SMART Recovery website is not affiliated with, or run by, SMART Recovery. The website and Discord server is managed by facilitators who have been trained by SMART Recovery and volunteer for SMART Recovery.</p>
