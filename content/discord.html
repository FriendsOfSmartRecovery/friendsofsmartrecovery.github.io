<h1>Join Our Discord Server</h1>
<br />
<p> One of the biggest predictors of whether or not someone can successfully give up an addiction is how supportive their community and the people they surround themselves with are. Our Discord Server was created to be a part of that support system.</p>
<br />
<p>Discord is a free, 24/7 chat app that hosts many communities (called "servers"). In the Friends of SMART Recovery Discord server, peers support one another, talking about healthy coping mechanisms, reminding each other that they are not alone in their struggles.</p>
<br />
<p>The server is created by, managed by, and attended by SMART-trained faciliators, ensuring that the server is a safe environment to be in. The server also has channels specific for Friends and Family of people who struggle with addiction, as well as more lighthearted sections to pass the time. </p>
