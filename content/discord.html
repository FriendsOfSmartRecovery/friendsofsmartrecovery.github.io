<h1>Join Our Discord Server</h1>
<br />
<p>We connect with each other through a private Discord server in which we provide support for our peers in-between official SMART Meetings.</p>
<br />
<p>Discord is a free, 24/7 chat app. You can join communities (servers) and chat with like-minded people. In the Friends of SMART Recovery Discord server, we help one another with our recovery. The biggest predictor is whether or not someone can successfully give up an addiction is their community and who they surround themselves with.</p>
