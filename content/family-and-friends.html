<h1>Family and Friends</h1>

<p>Being in a close relationship with someone struggling with addiction or problematic behaviors is highly stressful. SMART Recovery has many Family & Friends support meetings. These meetings are run by trained facilitators who often have their own experiences as a family member affected by a loved one's addiction.</p>
